### **Data Analysis Mini Project: PC Parts Sales**

#### **Project Overview**:
In this project, I will work with a **mock PC parts sales dataset** to test and improve my Pandas and Seaborn skills. The project focuses on tasks like **data cleaning**, **transformation**, and **analysis**. By handling real-world data challenges such as missing values and formatting, I will gain deeper insights into pc parts sales performance.
